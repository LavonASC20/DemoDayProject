        <p>This website is designed to help students learn financial literacy in a concise way, such that they'll be able to open and maintain a bank account. This is mostly geared towards high school and college students, but may be used by any curious person. This is also a website that puts information about many bank savings accounts into one place with only the important information displayed, saving the user time, effort, and brain power. Go to the "Search For Banks" menu and search for bank accounts. All of the accounts will appear at first, and you may type in any specific bank name to explore it.</p>
